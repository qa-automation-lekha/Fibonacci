# Fibonacci Series Generator

## Description

**FibonacciSeries** is a simple Java console application that generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a number of terms specified by the user. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.

## Features

- Prompts the user to enter the number of terms.
- Displays the Fibonacci series up to the given number of terms.
- Uses a simple `for` loop and basic arithmetic for calculation.

## What is the Fibonacci Sequence?

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
```
F(0) = 0  
F(1) = 1  
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
```

For example, the first 7 terms would be:
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
```

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher

## How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named `FibonacciSeries.java`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac FibonacciSeries.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java FibonacciSeries
   ```

## Example Output

```
Enter the number of terms for the series: 
7
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 
```
